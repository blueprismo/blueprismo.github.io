# Intro

This post will be revisited from time to time, but the goal is to provide a list of requests that seem to provide some fun.

## Wrong production instance

Engineer: Hey Team, customer "COOL_CUSTOMER" needs a fixed IP address for their instance (customerinstance.com)
Me: Hello, could you please send me the instance-manager link? It seems that instance is non-existent, the only 2 related instances to "COOL_CUSTOMER" are (aaaaaa.com, bbbbbb.com)
Engineer: I am not sure what happened but this is NOT for "COOL_CUSTOMER"! https://ccccc.com is the correct Instance that should receive the Fixed IP

Not sure what happened?
