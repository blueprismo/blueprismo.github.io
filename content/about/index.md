# About me

It all begins in 5th december 1998, I was born in France with a lovely twin, we were a present to my half a year old sister at the time, they are the best present life has ever given to me.

I am living in Berlin now. I really enjoy chess, my time alone, freediving, lofi and my fauvorite part of the day is the night :owl: .

Pixel-art and makes me feel homesick for a place I don't even know.
